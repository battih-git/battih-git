## Hi, I'm Huzefa 👋

AI / ML Engineer focused on building end-to-end machine learning and GenAI solutions,
from data preprocessing to deployment and monitoring.

### What I work on
- Machine Learning pipelines (training, evaluation, inference)
- GenAI applications (RAG, LLM agents, validation layers)
- Data drift detection & model monitoring
- Production-oriented ML using Docker & cloud services

### Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, SQL
- ML/DL: scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- GenAI: LLMs, RAG pipelines, LangChain
- MLOps: Docker, CI/CD basics, model monitoring
- Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2, SageMaker basics)

### Featured Projects
- ML-based decision systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbots
- Data drift and monitoring pipelines

### Currently Improving
- System design for ML
- GenAI reliability & hallucination control
- Scalable deployment patterns
